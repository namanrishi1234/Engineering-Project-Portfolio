# Engineering-Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio for my engineering-related projects.

## Energy-Based Audio Filtering Using FFT in MATLAB:
Repository link: https://github.com/namanrishi1234/Energy-Based-Audio-Filtering-Using-FFT-in-MATLAB

- MATLAB function which takes in an audio input and outputs both a lowpass and highpass filtered versions
- Uses FFT-based frequency domain analysis
- Determines appropriate cutoff frequency selection using cumulative signal energy calculations, 95% retention assumed
- Visualizes all 3 signals in the time and frequency domains using graphs.

## FPGA Reaction Time Tester:
Repository link: https://github.com/namanrishi1234/FPGA-Reaction-Time-Tester

- 2-player game which tests reaction speed via measuring the time it takes to click a button as soon as an LED light turns on
- Programmed in VHDL for a DE10-SoC FPGA board
- Program uses flip-flops and states for its design
- Incorporates soft-reset (resetting the player's turn) and hard-reset (resetting the full game) functionality
- Anti-cheating functionality included via preventing the player from resetting their turn as soon as they click the button
- 3 game-modes of easy, medium, and hard included, with each successive mode corresponding to a longer delay between the game starting and the LED light turning on

## SolidWorks Robotic Crane:
Repository link: https://github.com/namanrishi1234/SolidWorks-Robotic-Crane

- Modification of an existing robotic crane model in SolidWorks (link to original model: https://grabcad.com/library/robotic-crane-1)
- Arm was modified to be able to extend up to 2x its original length
- Wheels added for extra mobility
